# Peer 2 Peer University Lab Reports

## Intro
This series of documents are the way to share experiments, collaborations and best practice
with the community. When work we do together at/or with Peer 2 Peer University needs to be
showcased and reported, this is the right place to put them in.

## Usage
1. If you don't have git installed go ahead and install it.
Reference: https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git.
2. Clone this repository: "git@github.com:p2pu/reports.git"
Reference: https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo.
3. Once you have a copy of a reports folder on your computer, you can go ahead and make a
new report. The way to do it is to copy a folder called "[template][1]", rename
the copied folder accordingly and change ["index.html][2]"
file accordingly.
4. While changing your file, you can test your changes by opening file in browser and watch change
happening in front of your eyes.

## Tips
* Insert all of your text to appropriate places (places to insert text and structure the
document in the template are documented with comments. Replace comments accordingly)
* Put all of your photos in folder with the name "[img][3]"
* Change the path in "css[4]" folder for the header image
